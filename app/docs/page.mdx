# Welcome to MemVault

MemVault is a **Long-Term Memory as a Service** platform designed specifically for AI agents. Built on GraphRAG technology, it enables your AI systems to store, retrieve, and intelligently consolidate memories over time.

## What is MemVault?

Traditional AI models are stateless. They forget conversations the moment they end. MemVault solves this by providing a persistent memory layer that your AI agents can access across sessions, deployments, and even different applications.

Unlike simple vector databases, MemVault uses a hybrid approach that combines:

- **Vector similarity search** for semantic understanding
- **Knowledge graph traversal** for relationship-aware retrieval
- **Automatic consolidation** through intelligent sleep cycles

This creates a memory system that doesn't just store information—it organizes, refines, and improves over time.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Search

MemVault combines two powerful search paradigms:

**Vector Similarity:** Every memory is converted into a high-dimensional embedding using state-of-the-art models. This allows semantic search where "password reset" and "forgot my login" are understood as related concepts.

**Knowledge Graph Traversal:** Memories aren't isolated—they're connected through a graph structure. When you retrieve a memory, MemVault can traverse relationships to find contextually relevant information that pure vector search might miss.

The result? More accurate, context-aware memory retrieval that understands both meaning and relationships.

### Self-Organizing Sleep Cycles

This is MemVault's core differentiator.

Just like the human brain consolidates memories during sleep, MemVault runs automated **Sleep Cycles** every 6 hours. During these cycles, the system:

- **Merges duplicate or highly similar memories** to reduce redundancy
- **Strengthens important connections** between frequently co-accessed memories
- **Archives low-value memories** to keep your active memory space efficient
- **Updates relationship weights** in the knowledge graph based on usage patterns
- **Cleans up noise** and irrelevant data automatically

You don't need to manually manage memory hygiene—the system does it for you.

**Note:** Sleep Cycles are available on Direct and Pro plans. Hobby users get standard storage without automatic consolidation.

### Platform Agnostic

MemVault works with any LLM or AI framework:

- **OpenAI GPT models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- **Anthropic Claude** (Claude 3, Claude 2)
- **Open-source models** (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **Custom AI systems** built with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or from scratch

Use our official **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK** or call the REST API directly from any language.

### Official SDK Available

Get started faster with our official SDK:

```bash
npm install @memvault/client
```

**NPM Package:** [@memvault/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@memvault/client)

```typescript
import { MemVault } from '@memvault/client';

const memvault = new MemVault(process.env.MEMVAULT_API_KEY);

// Store a memory
await memvault.addMemory("Meeting was about Q4 budget");

// Search memories
const results = await memvault.retrieve("budget decisions");
console.log(results.memories);
```

## Use Cases

### AI Chatbots & Assistants

Give your chatbot long-term memory so it remembers user preferences, past conversations, and important context across sessions.

### Content Generation Systems

Maintain consistency in generated content by retrieving relevant past outputs and user feedback.

### Customer Support Automation

Remember customer issues, preferences, and history to provide personalized support experiences.

### Knowledge Management

Build a searchable knowledge base that understands semantic relationships between documents and concepts.

### CI/CD Intelligence

Store deployment history, test results, and incident reports to help your CI/CD pipelines learn from past events.
